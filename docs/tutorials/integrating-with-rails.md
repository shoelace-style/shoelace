# Integrating with Rails

This page explains how to integrate Shoelace with a Rails app.

?> This is a community-maintained document. Please [ask the community](/resources/community) if you have questions about this integration. You can also [suggest improvements](https://github.com/shoelace-style/shoelace/blob/next/docs/tutorials/integrating-with-rails.md) to make it better.

## Requirements

This integration has been tested with the following:

- Rails >= 6
- Node >= 12.10
- Yarn >= 1.22

## Instructions

When using Shoelace, there are mostly three things that need to be served to the client browser:

- Javascript files for the Web Components
- CSS files for light and dark themes (they can co-exist, but one of them is required)
- Shoelace Icons

Depending on the JS bundler you are using, you may need to do some additional configuration. However, the basic steps
should be just about the same. Also, it is recommended to read to the [Bundling section in the Installation](/getting-started/installation?id=bundling)
to understand how Shoalace can be set up with a JS bundler in general. In this tutorial, we will assume that your Rails
is already set up with a JS bundler that supports importing CSS files directly (e.g. Turbopack, esbuild, Vite).

To get started using Shoelace with Rails, the following package must be installed.

```bash
yarn add @shoelace-style/shoelace
```

This is required regardless of the JS bunlder you are using.

### Javascript & CSS

The next step is to import the JavaScript files and default theme for Shoelace. Add the following code to your
entrypoint JS file (generally `application.js`).

```js
// application.js
import '@shoelace-style/shoelace';

// You can also add these two if the JS bundler of your choise supports importing CSS files.
import '@shoelace-style/shoelace/dist/themes/light.css';
import '@shoelace-style/shoelace/dist/themes/dark.css'; // Optional dark mode
```

!> In this example, the entire dependencies are imported for simplisity. However, importing directly from
`@shoelace-style/shoelace` may result in a larger bundle size than necessary. Consider importing only the components
you actually need in the actual application.

You can also import the CSS if you prefer to maintain a separate entrypoint CSS file that is complied
independently.

```css
// application.css
@import '@shoelace-style/shoelace/dist/themes/light.css';
```

For more details about themes, please refer to [Theme Basics](/getting-started/themes?id=theme-basics).

### Serving up Shoelace Icons

#### Using the `shoelace-rails` gem

You do not have to do anything else if you are using [the `shoelace-rails` gem](https://github.com/yuki24/shoelace-rails).
Here are how it works in different environments:

- In development and test, the icons are served by the `ActionDispatch::Static` middleware, directly from the
  `node_modules/@shoelace-style/shoelace/dist/assets/icons` directory.
- In production, the icon files are automatically copied into the `public/assets` directory as part of the
  `assets:precompile` rake task.

#### Copying Icon files with a Rake task

TODO: ðŸš§ Write a bit more about why a rake task is recommended.

```ruby
# Rakefile
namespace :shoelace do
  namespace :icons do
    desc "Copy Shoelace icons to the assets path"
    task copy: :environment do
      cp_r "node_modules/@shoelace-style/shoelace/dist/assets", Rails.public_path
    end
  end
end

Rake::Task["assets:precompile"].enhance(["shoelace:icons:copy"])
```

TODO: ðŸš§ Write a bit more about copy plugins.

Now you can start using Shoelace components with Rails!

## Using Rails View Helpers

[the `shoelace-rails` gem](https://github.com/yuki24/shoelace-rails) is a community-maintained library that provides useful Rake tasks and Rails view helpers for
Shoelace components. In order to use it, add the gem by running the following command:

```bash
bundle add shoelace-rails
```

Once it is installed, you should be able to use the following view helpers to render Shoelace components:

```erb
<%= sl_form_for @user do |form| %>
  <%  # Text input: https://shoelace.style/components/input %>
  <%= form.text_field :name %>
  <%= form.password_field :password, placeholder: "Password Toggle", 'toggle-password': true %>

  <%  # Radio buttons: https://shoelace.style/components/color-picker %>
  <%= form.color_field :color %>

  <%  # Radio buttons: https://shoelace.style/components/radio %>
  <%= form.collection_radio_buttons :status, { id_1: "Option 1", id_2: "Option 2", id_3: "Option 3" }, :first, :last %>

  <%  # Select: https://shoelace.style/components/select %>
  <%= form.collection_select :tag, { id_1: "Option 1", id_2: "Option 2", id_3: "Option 3" }, :first, :last, {}, { placeholder: "Select one" } %>

  <%= form.submit %>
<% end %>
```

And this code will produce:

```html
<form class="new_user" id="new_user" data-remote="true" action="/" accept-charset="UTF-8" method="post">
  <sl-input label="Name" type="text" name="user[name]" id="user_name"></sl-input>
  <sl-input label="Password" type="password" name="user[password]" id="user_password"></sl-input>
  <sl-color-picker value="#ffffff" name="user[color]" id="user_color"></sl-color-picker>

  <sl-radio-group no-fieldset="true">
    <sl-radio value="id_1" name="user[status]" id="user_status_id_1">Option 1</sl-radio>
    <sl-radio value="id_2" name="user[status]" id="user_status_id_2">Option 2</sl-radio>
    <sl-radio value="id_3" name="user[status]" id="user_status_id_3">Option 3</sl-radio>
  </sl-radio-group>

  <sl-select placeholder="Select one" name="user[tag]" id="user_tag">
    <sl-menu-item value="id_1">Option 1</sl-menu-item>
    <sl-menu-item value="id_2">Option 2</sl-menu-item>
    <sl-menu-item value="id_3">Option 3</sl-menu-item>
  </sl-select>

  <sl-button submit="true" type="primary" data-disable-with="Create User">Create User</sl-button>
</form>
```
