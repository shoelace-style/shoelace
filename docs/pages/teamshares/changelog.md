# Changelog

## 2.0.0

- **MASSIVE** set of changes from upstream (jumping from 2.5.0 > 2.11.2). This included a big restructuring of the codebase in upstream 2.6.0, which moved the component code into separate `name.component.ts` files. Lots of other files got moved around, the build process changed, and the docs site is now using eleventy. Please see the upstream change logs for more details.

- Badge
  - Update styling
  - Add new color theme variants: red (default) and gray
  - Map existing semantic variants to newly added colors (neutral = gray, danger = red)
  - Make `pill` option the default; add `square` boolean to display a square badge
    - If you were previously using the `pill` boolean to display a pill badge, you can now delete that boolean from your `sl-badge`.
    - If you were previously using the default square badge, you’ll need to add a `square` boolean to get the square badge back. (Note: The square badge is not a standard Teamshares Design System pattern, so please check with the designer on your team about this usage).
  - Add new value attribute to auto-format numbers > 99
- Button

  - Add helper tips and warning alerts above examples to highlight patterns that are available with Shoelace but aren’t standard options for the Teamshares Design System
