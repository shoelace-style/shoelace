# Changelog

Shoelace follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Breaking changes in components with the <sl-badge type="primary" pill>Stable</sl-badge> badge will not be accepted until the next major version. As such, all contributions must consider the project's roadmap and take this into consideration. Features that are deemed no longer necessary will be deprecated but not removed.

Components with the <sl-badge type="warning" pill>Experimental</sl-badge> badge should not be used in production. They are made available as release candidates for development and testing purposes. As such, changes to experimental components will not be subject to semantic versioning.

_During the beta period, these restrictions may be relaxed in the event of a mission-critical bug._ 🐛

## Nexts

- Add touch support to `sl-rating` [#362](https://github.com/shoelace-style/shoelace/pull/362)
- Fixed a bug where the `open` attribute on `sl-details` would prevent it from opening [#357](https://github.com/shoelace-style/shoelace/issues/357)
- Fixed event detail type parsing so component class names are shown instead of `default`

## 2.0.0-beta.30

- Fix default exports for all components so cherry picking works again [#365](https://github.com/shoelace-style/shoelace/issues/365)
- Revert FOUC base style because it interferes with some framework and custom element use cases

## 2.0.0-beta.29

**This release migrates component implementations from Shoemaker to LitElement.** Due to feedback from the community, Shoelace will rely on a more heavily tested library for component implementations. This gives you a more solid foundation and reduces my maintenance burden. Thank you for all your comments, concerns, and encouragement! Aside from that, everything else from beta.28 still applies plus the following.

- 🚨 BREAKING: removed the `symbol` prop from `sl-rating` and reverted to `getSymbol` for optimal flexibility
- Added `vscode.html-custom-data.json` to the build to support IntelliSense (see [the usage section](/getting-started/usage#code-completion) for details)
- Added a base style to prevent FOUC before components are defined
- Fixed bug where TypeScript types weren't being generated [#364](https://github.com/shoelace-style/shoelace/pull/364)
- Improved vertical padding in `sl-tooltip`
- Moved chunk files into a separate folder
- Reverted menu item active styles
- Updated esbuild to 0.8.54

## 2.0.0-beta.28

**This release includes a major under the hood overhaul of the library and how it's distributed.** Until now, Shoelace was developed with Stencil. This release moves to a lightweight tool called Shoemaker, a homegrown utility that provides declarative templating and data binding while reducing the boilerplate required for said features.

This change in tooling addresses a number of longstanding bugs and limitations. It also gives us more control over the library and build process while streamlining development and maintenance. Instead of two different distributions, Shoelace now offers a single, standards-compliant collection of ES modules. This may affect how you install and use the library, so please refer to the [installation page](/getting-started/installation) for details.

!> Due to the large number of internal changes, I would consider this update to be less stable than previous ones. If you're using Shoelace in a production app, consider holding off until the next beta to allow for more exhaustive testing from the community. Please report any bugs you find on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/shoelace-style/shoelace/issues).

The component API remains the same except for the changes noted below. Thanks for your patience as I work diligently to make Shoelace more stable and future-proof. 🙌

- 🚨 BREAKING: removed the custom elements bundle (you can import ES modules directly)
- 🚨 BREAKING: removed `getAnimationNames()` and `getEasingNames()` methods from `sl-animation` (you can import them from `utilities/animation.js` instead)
- 🚨 BREAKING: removed the `sl-icon-library` component since it required imperative initialization (you can import the `registerIconLibrary()` function from `utilities/icon-library.js` instead)
- 🚨 BREAKING: removed the experimental `sl-theme` component due to limitations (you should set the `sl-theme-[name]` class on the `<body>` instead)
- 🚨 BREAKING: moved the base stylesheet from `dist/shoelace.css` to `dist/themes/base.css`
- 🚨 BREAKING: moved `icons` into `assets/icons` to make future assets easier to colocate
- 🚨 BREAKING: changed `getSymbol` prop in `sl-rating` to `symbol` (it now accepts a string or a function that returns an icon name)
- 🚨 BREAKING: renamed `setAssetPath()` to `setBasePath()` and added the ability to set the library's base path with a `data-shoelace` attribute (`setBasePath()` is exported from `utilities/base-path.js`)

### Why did event names change?

Shoelace events were updated to use a lowercase, kebab-style naming convention. Instead of event names such as `slChange` and `slAfterShow`, you'll need to use `sl-change` and `sl-after-show` now.

This change was necessary to address a critical issue in frameworks that use DOM templates with declarative event bindings such as `<sl-button @slChange="handler">`. Due to HTML's case-insensitivity, browsers translate attribute names to lowercase, turning `@slChange` into `@slchange`, making it impossible to listen to `slChange`.

While declarative event binding is a non-standard feature, not supporting it would make Shoelace much harder to use in popular frameworks. To accommodate those users and provide a better developer experience, we decided to change the naming convention while Shoelace is still in beta.

The following pages demonstrate why this change was necessary.
