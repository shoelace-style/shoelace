# Changelog

Shoelace follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Breaking changes in components with the <sl-badge variant="primary" pill>Stable</sl-badge> badge will not be accepted until the next major version. As such, all contributions must consider the project's roadmap and take this into consideration. Features that are deemed no longer necessary will be deprecated but not removed.

Components with the <sl-badge variant="warning" pill>Experimental</sl-badge> badge should not be used in production. They are made available as release candidates for development and testing purposes. As such, changes to experimental components will not be subject to semantic versioning.

_During the beta period, these restrictions may be relaxed in the event of a mission-critical bug._ üêõ

## 2.0.0-beta.61

This release improves the dark theme by shifting luminance in both directions, slightly condensing the spectrum. This results in richer colors in dark mode. It also reduces theme stylesheet sizes by eliminating superfluous gray palette variations.

In [beta.48](#_200-beta48), I introduced a change to color tokens that allowed you to access alpha values at the expense of a verbose, non-standard syntax. After considering feedback from the community, I've decided to revert this change so the `rgb()` function is no longer required. Many users reported never using it for alpha, and even more reported having trouble remembering to use `rgb()` and that it was causing more harm than good.

Furthermore, both Safari and Firefox have implemented [`color-mix()`](<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/color-mix()>) behind a flag, so access to alpha channels and other capabilities are coming to the browser soon.

If you're using color tokens in your own stylesheet, simply remove the `rgb()` to update to this version.

```css
.your-styles {
  /* change this */
  color: rgb(var(--sl-color-primary-500));

  /* to this */
  color: var(--sl-color-primary-500);
}
```

Thank you for your help and patience with testing Shoelace. I promise, we're not far from a stable release!

## 2.0.0-beta.58

This version once again restores the bundled distribution because the unbundled + CDN approach is currently confusing and [not working properly](https://github.com/shoelace-style/shoelace/issues/559#issuecomment-949662331). Unbundling the few dependencies Shoelace has is still a goal of the project, but [this jsDelivr bug](https://github.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr/issues/18337) needs to be resolved before we can achieve it.

I sincerely apologize for the instability of the last few beta releases as a result of this effort.

- Added experimental `<sl-animated-image>` component
- Added `label` attribute to `<sl-progress-bar>` and `<sl-progress-ring>` to improve a11y
- Fixed a bug where the tooltip would show briefly when clicking a disabled `<sl-range>`
- Fixed a bug that caused a console error when `<sl-range>` was used
- Fixed a bug where the `nav` part in `<sl-tab-group>` was on the incorrect element [#563](https://github.com/shoelace-style/shoelace/pull/563)
- Fixed a bug where non-integer aspect ratios were calculated incorrectly in `<sl-responsive-media>`

- Reverted to publishing the bundled dist and removed `/+esm` links from the docs
- Updated to Bootstrap Icons to 1.6.1

## 2.0.0-beta.57

- Fix CodePen links and CDN links

## 2.0.0-beta.56

This release is the second attempt at unbundling dependencies. This will be a breaking change only if your configuration _does not_ support bare module specifiers. CDN users and bundler users will be unaffected, but note the URLs for modules on the CDN must have the `/+esm` now.

- Added the `hoist` attribute to `<sl-tooltip>` [#564](https://github.com/shoelace-style/shoelace/issues/564)
- Unbundled dependencies and configured external imports to be packaged with bare module specifiers

## 2.0.0-beta.55

- Revert unbundling due to issues with the CDN not handling bare module specifiers as expected

## 2.0.0-beta.54

Shoelace doesn't have a lot of dependencies, but this release unbundles most of them so you can potentially save some extra kilobytes. This will be a breaking change only if your configuration _does not_ support bare module specifiers. CDN users and bundler users will be unaffected.

- üö® BREAKING: renamed the `sl-clear` event to `sl-remove`, the `clear-button` part to `remove-button`, and the `clearable` property to `removable` in `<sl-tag>`
- Added the `disabled` prop to `<sl-resize-observer>`

- Updated to Lit 2.0 and lit-html 2.0 üî•

## 2.0.0-beta.51

A number of users had trouble counting characters that repeat, so this release improves design token patterns so that "t-shirt sizes" are more accessible. For example, `--sl-font-size-xxx-large` has become `--sl-font-size-3x-large`. This change applies to all design tokens that use this scale.

- üö® BREAKING: all t-shirt size design tokens now use `2x`, `3x`, `4x` instead of `xx`, `xxx`, `xxxx`
- Added missing `--sl-focus-ring-*` tokens to dark theme
- Added an "Importing" section to all components with copy/paste code to make cherry picking easier

- Removed `<sl-icon>` dependency from `<sl-color-picker>` and improved the copy animation

## 2.0.0-beta.50

- Added `<sl-breadcrumb>` and `<sl-breadcrumb-item>` components
- Added `--sl-letter-spacing-denser`, `--sl-letter-spacing-looser`, `--sl-line-height-denser`, and `--sl-line-height-looser` design tokens
- Fixed a bug where form controls would error out when the value was set to `undefined` [#513](https://github.com/shoelace-style/shoelace/pull/513)

## 2.0.0-beta.49

This release changes the way focus states are applied to elements. In browsers that support [`:focus-visible`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:focus-visible), it will be used. In unsupportive browsers ([currently only Safari](https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_selectors_focus-visible)), `:focus` will be used instead. This means the browser will determine whether a focus ring should be shown based on how the user interacts with the page.

This release also fixes a critical bug in the color scale where `--sl-color-neutral-0` and `--sl-color-neutral-1000` were reversed.

- üö® BREAKING: fixed a bug where `--sl-color-neutral-0` and `--sl-color-neutral-1000` were inverted (swap them to update)
- üö® BREAKING: removed the `no-fieldset` property from `<sl-radio-group>` (fieldsets are now hidden by default; use `fieldset` to show them)
- üö® BREAKING: removed `--focus-ring` custom property from `<sl-input>`, `<sl-select>`, `<sl-tab>` for consistency with other form controls
- Added `--swatch-size` custom property to `<sl-color-picker>`
- Added `date` to `<sl-input>` as a supported `type`
- Added the `--sl-focus-ring` design token for a more convenient way to apply focus ring styles
- Adjusted elevation tokens to use neutral in light mode and black in dark mode
- Adjusted `--sl-overlay-background-color` in dark theme to be black instead of gray
- Fixed a bug in `<sl-color-picker>` where the opacity slider wasn't showing the current color
- Fixed a bug where Edge in Windows would show the native password toggle next to the custom password toggle [#508](https://github.com/shoelace-style/shoelace/issues/508)
- Fixed a bug where pressing up/down in `<sl-tab-group>` didn't select the next/previous tab in vertical placements
- Improved size of `<sl-color-picker>`
- Improved icon contrast in `<sl-input>`
- Improved contrast of `<sl-switch>`
- Improved `:focus-visible` behavior in many components
- Removed elevation from `<sl-color-picker>` when rendered inline
- Removed custom `:focus-visible` logic in favor of a directive that outputs `:focus-visible` or `:focus` depending on browser support
- Updated to Lit 2.0.0-rc.3
- Updated to lit-html 2.0.0-rc.4

## 2.0.0-beta.48

This release improves theming by offering both light and dark themes that can be used autonomously. It also improves contrast in most components, adds a variety of new color primitives, and changes the way color tokens are consumed.

Previously, color tokens were in hexadecimal format. Now, Shoelace now uses an `R G B` format that requires you to use the `rgb()` function in your CSS.

```css
.example {
  /* rgb() is required now */
  color: var(--sl-color-neutral-500);
}
```

This is more verbose than previous versions, but it has the advantage of letting you set the alpha channel of any color token.

```css
.example-with-alpha {
  /* easily adjust opacity for any color token */
  color: rgb(var(--sl-color-neutral-500) / 50%);
}
```

This change applies to all design tokens that implement a color. Refer to the [color tokens](/tokens/color) page for more details.

- üö® BREAKING: all design tokens that implement colors have been converted to `R G B` and must be used with the `rgb()` function
- üö® BREAKING: removed `--sl-color-black|white` color tokens (use `--sl-color-neutral-0|1000` instead)
- üö® BREAKING: removed `--sl-color-primary|success|warning|info|danger-text` design tokens (use theme or primitive colors instead)
- üö® BREAKING: removed `info` variant from `<sl-alert>`, `<sl-badge>`, `<sl-button>`, and `<sl-tag>` (use `neutral` instead)
- üö® BREAKING: removed `--sl-color-info-*` design token (use `--sl-color-neutral-*` instead)
- üö® BREAKING: renamed `dist/themes/base.css` to `dist/themes/light.css`
- üö® BREAKING: removed `--sl-focus-ring-color-primary` tokens (use color tokens and `--sl-focus-ring-width|alpha` instead)
- üö® BREAKING: removed `--tabs-border-color` from `<sl-tab-group>` (use `--track-color` instead)
- üö® BREAKING: changed the default value for `effect` to `none` in `<sl-skeleton>` (use `sheen` to restore the original behavior)
- Added new color primitives to the base set of design tokens
- Added `--sl-color-*-950` swatches to all color palettes
- Added a console error that appears when menu items have duplicate values in `<sl-select>`
- Added CodePen link to code examples
- Added `prefix` and `suffix` slots to `<sl-select>` [#501](https://github.com/shoelace-style/shoelace/pull/501)
- Added `--indicator-color` custom property to `<sl-tab-group>`
- Exposed base and dark stylesheets so they can be imported via JavaScript [#438](https://github.com/shoelace-style/shoelace/issues/438)
- Fixed a bug in `<sl-menu>` where pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd> after using type to select would result in the wrong value
- Fixed a bug in `<sl-radio-group>` where clicking a radio button would cause the wrong control to be focused
- Fixed a bug in `<sl-button>` and `<sl-icon-button>` where an unintended `ref` attribute was present
- Fixed a bug in the focus-visible utility that failed to respond to mouseup events
- Fixed a bug where clicking on a menu item would persist its hover/focus state
- Fixed a bug in `<sl-select>` where it would erroneously intercept important keyboard shortcuts [#504](https://github.com/shoelace-style/shoelace/issues/504)
- Improved contrast throughout all components [#128](https://github.com/shoelace-style/shoelace/issues/128)
- Refactored thumb position logic in `<sl-switch>` [#490](https://github.com/shoelace-style/shoelace/pull/490)
- Reworked the dark theme to use an inverted + shifted design token approach instead of component-specific selectors

## 2.0.0-beta.47

This release improves how component dependencies are imported. If you've been cherry picking, you no longer need to import component dependencies manually. This significantly improves developer experience, making Shoelace even easier to use. For transparency, component dependencies will continue to be listed in the docs.

- Added "Reflects" column to the properties table
- Dependencies are now automatically imported for all components
- Fixed a bug where tabbing into `<sl-radio-group>` would not always focus the checked radio
- Fixed a bug in component styles that prevented the box sizing reset from being applied
- Fixed a regression in `<sl-color-picker>` where dragging the grid handle wasn't smooth
- Fixed a bug where slot detection could incorrectly match against slots of child elements [#481](https://github.com/shoelace-style/shoelace/pull/481)
- Fixed a bug in `<sl-input>` where focus would move to the end of the input when typing in Safari [#480](https://github.com/shoelace-style/shoelace/issues/480)
- Improved base path utility logic

## 2.0.0-beta.46

This release improves the developer experience of `<sl-animation>`. Previously, an animation was assumed to be playing unless the `pause` attribute was set. This behavior has been reversed and `pause` has been removed. Now, animations will not play until the new `play` attribute is applied.

This is a lot more intuitive and makes it easier to activate animations imperatively. In addition, the `play` attribute is automatically removed automatically when the animation finishes or cancels, making it easier to restart finite animations. Lastly, the animation's timing is now accessible through the new `currentTime` property instead of `getCurrentTime()` and `setCurrentTime()`.

In addition, Shoelace no longer uses Sass. Component styles now use Lit's template literal styles and theme files use pure CSS.

- üö® BREAKING: removed the `pause` attribute from `<sl-animation>` (use `play` to start and stop the animation instead)
- üö® BREAKING: removed `getCurrentTime()` and `setCurrentTime()` from `<sl-animation>` (use the `currentTime` property instead)
- üö® BREAKING: removed the `close-on-select` attribute from `<sl-dropdown>` (use `stay-open-on-select` instead)
- Added the `currentTime` property to `<sl-animation>` to control the current time without methods
- Fixed a bug in `<sl-range>` where the tooltip wasn't showing in Safari [#477](https://github.com/shoelace-style/shoelace/issues/477)
- Fixed a bug in `<sl-menu>` where pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd> in a menu didn't work with click handlers
- Reworked `<sl-menu>` and `<sl-menu-item>` to use a roving tab index and improve keyboard accessibility
- Reworked tabbable logic to be more performant [#466](https://github.com/shoelace-style/shoelace/issues/466)
- Switched component stylesheets from Sass to Lit's template literal styles
- Switched theme stylesheets from Sass to CSS

## 2.0.0-beta.45

This release changes the way component metadata is generated. Previously, the project used TypeDoc to analyze components and generate a very large file with type data. The data was then parsed and converted to an easier-to-consume file called `metadata.json`. Alas, TypeDoc is expensive to run and the metadata format wasn't standard.

Thanks to an amazing effort by [Pascal Schilp](https://twitter.com/passle_), the world has a simpler, faster way to gather metadata using the [Custom Elements Manifest Analyzer](https://github.com/open-wc/custom-elements-manifest). Not only is this tool faster, but the data follows the evolving `custom-elements.json` format. This is exciting because a standard format for custom elements opens the door for many potential uses, including documentation generation, framework adapters, IDE integrations, third-party uses, and more. [Check out Pascal's great article](https://dev.to/open-wc/introducing-custom-elements-manifest-gkk) for more info about `custom-elements.json` and the new analyzer.

The docs have been updated to use the new `custom-elements.json` file. If you're relying on the old `metadata.json` file for any purpose, this will be a breaking change for you.

- üö® BREAKING: removed the `sl-overlay-click` event from `<sl-dialog>` and `<sl-drawer>` (use `sl-request-close` instead) [#471](https://github.com/shoelace-style/shoelace/discussions/471)

## 2.0.0-beta.42

This release addresses an issue with the `open` attribute no longer working in a number of components, as a result of the changes in beta.41. It also removes a small but controversial feature that complicated show/hide logic and led to a poor experience for developers and end users.

There are two ways to show/hide affected components: by calling `show() | hide()` and by toggling the `open` prop. Previously, it was possible to call `event.preventDefault()` in an `sl-show | sl-hide ` handler to stop the component from showing/hiding. The problem becomes obvious when you set `el.open = false`, the event gets canceled, and in the next cycle `el.open` has reverted to `true`. Not only is this unexpected, but it also doesn't play nicely with frameworks. Additionally, this made it impossible to await `show() | hide()` since there was a chance they'd never resolve.

Technical reasons aside, canceling these events seldom led to a good user experience, so the decision was made to no longer allow `sl-show | sl-hide` to be cancelable.

- Fixed a bug in `<sl-range>` where setting a value outside the default `min` or `max` would clamp the value [#448](https://github.com/shoelace-style/shoelace/issues/448)
- Fixed a bug in `<sl-dropdown>` where placement wouldn't adjust properly when shown [#447](https://github.com/shoelace-style/shoelace/issues/447)
- Fixed a bug in the internal `shimKeyframesHeightAuto` utility that caused `<sl-details>` to measure heights incorrectly [#445](https://github.com/shoelace-style/shoelace/issues/445)
- Fixed a number of imports that should have been type imports
- Updated Lit to 2.0.0-rc.2
- Updated esbuild to 0.12.4

## 2.0.0-beta.41

This release changes how components animate. In previous versions, CSS transitions were used for most show/hide animations. Transitions are problematic due to the way `transitionend` works. This event fires once _per transition_, and it's impossible to know which transition to look for when users can customize any possible CSS property. Because of this, components previously required the `opacity` property to transition. If a user were to prevent `opacity` from transitioning, the component wouldn't hide properly and the `sl-after-show|hide` events would never emit.

CSS animations, on the other hand, have a more reliable `animationend` event. Alas, `@keyframes` don't cascade and can't be injected into a shadow DOM via CSS, so there would be no good way to customize them.

The most elegant solution I found was to use the [Web Animations API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Animations_API), which offers more control over animations at the expense of customizations being done in JavaScript. Fortunately, through the [Animation Registry](/getting-started/customizing#animations), you can customize animations globally and/or per component with a minimal amount of code.

## 2.0.0-beta.34

This release changes the way components are registered if you're [cherry picking](/getting-started/installation?id=cherry-picking) or [using a bundler](/getting-started/installation?id=bundling). This recommendation came from the LitElement team and simplifies Shoelace's dependency graph. It also eliminates the need to call a `register()` function before using each component.

From now on, importing a component will register it automatically. The caveat is that bundlers may not tree shake the library properly if you import from `@shoelace-style/shoelace`, so the recommendation is to import components and utilities from their corresponding files instead.

- üö® BREAKING: removed `all.shoelace.js` (use `shoelace.js` instead)
- üö® BREAKING: component modules now have a side effect, so bundlers may not tree shake properly when importing from `@shoelace-style/shoelace` (see the [installation page](/getting-started/installation?id=bundling) for more details and how to update)
- Added `sl-clear` event to `<sl-select>`
- Fixed a bug where dynamically changing menu items in `<sl-select>` would cause the display label to be blank [#374](https://github.com/shoelace-style/shoelace/discussions/374)
- Fixed a bug where setting the `value` attribute or property on `<sl-input>` and `<sl-textarea>` would trigger validation too soon
- Fixed the margin in `<sl-menu-label>` to align with menu items
- Fixed `autofocus` attributes in `<sl-input>` and `<sl-textarea>`
- Improved types for `autocapitalize` in `<sl-input>` and `<sl-textarea>`
- Reverted the custom `@tag` decorator in favor of `@customElement` to enable auto-registration

## 2.0.0-beta.33

- Fixed a bug where link buttons could have incorrect `target`, `download`, and `rel` props
- Fixed `aria-label` and `aria-labelledby` props in `<sl-dialog>` and `<sl-drawer>`
- Fixed `tabindex` attribute in `<sl-menu>`
- Fixed a bug in `<sl-select>` where tags would always render as pills
- Fixed a bug in `<sl-button>` where calling `setFocus()` would throw an error

## 2.0.0-beta.32

- Added tag name maps so TypeScript can identify Shoelace elements [#371](https://github.com/shoelace-style/shoelace/pull/371)

- Fixed a bug where `sl-change` wasn't emitted by `<sl-checkbox>` or `<sl-switch>` [#370](https://github.com/shoelace-style/shoelace/issues/370)
- Fixed a bug where some props weren't being watched correctly in `<sl-alert>` and `<sl-color-picker>`
- Improved `@watch` decorator so watch handlers don't run before the first render
- Removed guards that were added due to previous watch handler behavior

## 2.0.0-beta.31

- Add touch support to `<sl-rating>` [#362](https://github.com/shoelace-style/shoelace/pull/362)

- Fixed event detail type parsing so component class names are shown instead of `default`

## 2.0.0-beta.30

- Fix default exports for all components so cherry picking works again [#365](https://github.com/shoelace-style/shoelace/issues/365)
- Revert FOUC base style because it interferes with some framework and custom element use cases

## 2.0.0-beta.29

**This release migrates component implementations from Shoemaker to LitElement.** Due to feedback from the community, Shoelace will rely on a more heavily tested library for component implementations. This gives you a more solid foundation and reduces my maintenance burden. Thank you for all your comments, concerns, and encouragement! Aside from that, everything else from beta.28 still applies plus the following.

- üö® BREAKING: removed the `symbol` property from `<sl-rating>` and reverted to `getSymbol` for optimal flexibility
- Added `vscode.html-custom-data.json` to the build to support IntelliSense (see [the usage section](/getting-started/usage#code-completion) for details)
- Added a base style to prevent FOUC before components are defined
- Fixed bug where TypeScript types weren't being generated [#364](https://github.com/shoelace-style/shoelace/pull/364)
- Improved vertical padding in `<sl-tooltip>`
- Moved chunk files into a separate folder
- Reverted menu item active styles
- Updated esbuild to 0.8.54

## 2.0.0-beta.28

**This release includes a major under the hood overhaul of the library and how it's distributed.** Until now, Shoelace was developed with Stencil. This release moves to a lightweight tool called Shoemaker, a homegrown utility that provides declarative templating and data binding while reducing the boilerplate required for said features.

This change in tooling addresses a number of longstanding bugs and limitations. It also gives us more control over the library and build process while streamlining development and maintenance. Instead of two different distributions, Shoelace now offers a single, standards-compliant collection of ES modules. This may affect how you install and use the library, so please refer to the [installation page](/getting-started/installation) for details.

!> Due to the large number of internal changes, I would consider this update to be less stable than previous ones. If you're using Shoelace in a production app, consider holding off until the next beta to allow for more exhaustive testing from the community. Please report any bugs you find on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/shoelace-style/shoelace/issues).

The component API remains the same except for the changes noted below. Thanks for your patience as I work diligently to make Shoelace more stable and future-proof. üôå

### Why did event names change?

Shoelace events were updated to use a lowercase, kebab-style naming convention. Instead of event names such as `slChange` and `slAfterShow`, you'll need to use `sl-change` and `sl-after-show` now.

This change was necessary to address a critical issue in frameworks that use DOM templates with declarative event bindings such as `<sl-button @slChange="handler">`. Due to HTML's case-insensitivity, browsers translate attribute names to lowercase, turning `@slChange` into `@slchange`, making it impossible to listen to `slChange`.

While declarative event binding is a non-standard feature, not supporting it would make Shoelace much harder to use in popular frameworks. To accommodate those users and provide a better developer experience, we decided to change the naming convention while Shoelace is still in beta.

The following pages demonstrate why this change was necessary.
